# Alex Thola

Staff Software Engineer and manager for a team of six building cybersecurity tools in Rust and Python. Based in Central Texas.

I got into software security through reverse engineering and systems programming after graduating from UT with a math degree. My first role out of college was hacking Nissan ECUs to unlock massive performance gains for race engines. From there, I moved into my current role leading a team focused on network security applications.

## What I Do

I lead an engineering team that builds network security tools, where I split my time between technical leadership and hands-on coding. I mentor a team of six (five software engineers and one test engineer) and design our system architecture. As a recent example, I orchestrated a systems engineering project built for speed and security in Rust.

When I'm writing code, it's primarily Rust for performance-sensitive services. I also contribute to open-source projects in test automation and Rust cryptography, and apply my math background to research on ML-based threat detection and network graph algorithms.

## Tech Stack

My daily drivers are **Rust** and **Python**.  I use C++ and C# when a project requires interfacing with legacy systems or Windows-specific APIs.

## Recent Projects

### [Importobot](https://github.com/athola/importobot)
A Python tool that converts test cases from Zephyr, JIRA, and TestLink to Robot Framework. I built it to automate a manual migration of thousands of test cases that would have taken a team of test engineers months to complete. The tool is on PyPI and runs in minutes.

### [EasyResume](https://github.com/athola/importobot)
A Python tool for generating print-ready resumes from YAML. I created this while job hunting because I was frustrated with the limitations of word processors and expensive online resume builders. It uses text and font rendering to produce clean resumes. The tool is on PyPI and seamlessly converts YAML to PDF or HTML in seconds.

## Background

I graduated with a math degree from UT (hook 'em) and developed a passion for cybersecurity through CTFs and reverse engineering challenges. A hobbyist interest in deconstructing binaries with Ghidra and Python led to my first reverse engineering job hacking Nissan ECUs.
