# Alex Thola

Staff Software Engineer and manager for a team of six building cybersecurity tools in Rust and Python. Based in Central Texas.

I got into software security through reverse engineering and systems programming after graduating from UT with a math degree. My first role out of college was hacking Nissan ECUs to unlock massive performance gains for race engines. From there, I moved into my current role leading a team focused on network security applications.

## What I Do

I lead an engineering team that builds network security tools, where I split my time between technical leadership and hands-on coding. I mentor a team of six (five software engineers and one test engineer) and design our system architecture. As a recent example, I orchestrated a systems engineering project built for speed and security in Rust.

When I'm writing code, it's primarily Rust for performance-sensitive services. I also contribute to open-source projects in test automation and Rust cryptography, and apply my math background to research on ML-based threat detection and network graph algorithms.

## Tech Stack

My daily drivers are **Rust** and **Python**.  I use C++ and C# when a project requires interfacing with legacy systems or Windows-specific APIs.

## Recent Projects

### [ImportoBot](https://github.com/athola/importobot)
A Python tool that converts test cases from formats like Zephyr, JIRA, and TestLink into Robot Framework. I built it because our team was facing a manual migration of thousands of test cases, which would be a multi-month effort for a team of test engineers. The tool is now on PyPI and does the job in minutes.

## Background

I graduated with a math degree from UT (hook 'em) and developed a passion for cybersecurity through CTFs and reverse engineering challenges. A hobbyist interest in deconstructing binaries with Ghidra and Python led to my first reverse engineering job hacking Nissan ECUs.
