# Alex Thola

Staff Software Engineer building cybersecurity tools in Rust and Python. Currently managing a team of 6 engineers while working on network security applications and open source automation tools.

Based in Central Texas. UT Math grad who got into security through reverse engineering, which led into a deep obsession with systems programming.

## What I Do

I manage an engineering team focused on network security tools. Most of my time goes into:

- Writing Rust code for AppSecDev solutions
- Managing 6 direct reports and helping them grow technically
- Making architecture decisions - recently led a Pythonâ†’Rust migration that made our core pipeline 10x faster
- Contributing to open source projects, especially around test automation and Rust cryptography

I apply my math background towards researching network graph algorithms and ML threat detection models.

## Tech Stack

Daily drivers: **Rust** and **Python**. I write C++ when I need to interface with legacy systems, and C# for Windows-specific security tools.

## Recent Projects

### [ImportoBot](https://github.com/athola/importobot)
Python tool that converts test cases from various formats (Zephyr, JIRA, TestLink) into Robot Framework. Built this because manually migrating thousands of test cases is an insane proposition.

Now it's on PyPI and processes 1000+ test cases in minutes instead of weeks.

## Background

Started with a math degree from UT Austin, developed a passion for cybersecurity through CTFs and reverse engineering challenges. Spent a lot of time with Ghidra and Python scripts reverse engineering interesting binaries. Even got to hack Nissan ECUs for a living!

These days I split time between:
- **Managing people** (6 direct reports, lots of 1:1s and technical mentoring)
- **Writing code** (mostly Rust for performance-critical stuff, Python for automation)
- **Making decisions** about system architecture and technology choices
- **Research** into network graph algorithms and ML applications in security

I have the privilege to balance mentorship with architecting systems to solve fascinating problems.
